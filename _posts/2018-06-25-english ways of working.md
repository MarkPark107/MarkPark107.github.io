> ## Ways of working

As world is changing, a shape of working is also changed. Here are some working ways of people. Which ones are old and new?

> I'm an **office worker** in an insuransce company. It's a **nine-to-five** job with regualr **working hours**. The work isn't very interesting, but I like to be able to go home at a resonable time.
>
> We all have to **clock in** and **clock out** everyday. In this company, even the managers have to, which is unusual!
>
> \* You also say **clock on** and **clock off**



> I'm in computer programming. There's a system of **flexitime** in my company, which means we can work when we want, within certain limits. We can start at any time before eleven, and finish as early as three, as long as we do enough hours each month. It's ideal for me as I have two young children.
>
> \* BrE : **flexitime**, AmE : **flextime**



> I work in a car plant. I work in **shifts**. I may be on the **day shift** one week and the **night shift** the next week. It's difficult changing from one shift to another. When I change shifts, I have problems changing to a new routine for sleeping and eating.



> I'm a commercial artist in an advertising agency. I work in a big city, but I prefer living in the country, so I **commute** to work every day, like thousands of other **commuters**. **Working from home** using a computer and the Internet is becoming more and more popular, and the agency is introducing this: it's called **teleworking** or **telecommuting**. But I like going into the office and working with other people around me.
