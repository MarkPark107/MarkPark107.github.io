> #### Trade credit

Vaclav is talking about his furniture business:

'Of course, we don't expect our business customers to pay immediately. They are given **trade credit**, a period of time before they have to pay, usually 30 or 60 days. If a customer orders a large quantity or pays within a particular time, we give them a **discount**, a **reduction** in teh amount they have to pay.

But with some customers, especially ones we haven't dealt with before, wef ask them to pay **upfront**, before they receive the goods.

Like all businesses, we have a **credit policy**, with **payment terms**: rules on when and how customers should pay. This is part of controlling **cash flow**, the timing of payments coming into and going out of a business.'
