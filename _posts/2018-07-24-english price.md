## Price

> #### Pricing

M : Our goods are **low-priced**. Permanently low **pricing** means we charge low prices all the time. 

W : You mean **cheap**: your goods are poor quality. Our goods are **high-priced**, but we give customer service. And a lot of our goods are **mid-priced** : not cheap and not expensive.

M : Your goods are **expensive**. Customers don't need service. 

W : You must be selling some goods **at cost**(what you pay for them) or **at a loss**(even less).

M : Yes. We have **loss leaders** - cheap items to attract customers in. But it's all below the 'official' **list price** or **recommended retail price**. We have a policy of **discounting**, selling **at a discount** to the list price.

W : (If he goes on **undercutting** us, we can't stay in business.)
