> ## Materials and Suppliers

> #### Inputs

Dryden makes vaccum cleaners. It takes **raw materials** like steel and plastic and makes some of the **components** or **parts** used in its products. Other components are made by other companies.

Meterials and parts are just some of the inputs. The other are **labour**(workers and managers) and **capital**(money). **Knowledge** is also important because Dryden is a leader in vaccuum technology.

Vaccum cleaners that are being made are **work-in-progress**. At any one thime, Dryden has goods worth millions of dollars in its factories and warehouses: the products that hav been made its **finished goods** - and materials and components.

Quantities of raw materials, components, work-in-progress and finished goods in a particular place are **stocks**

Note : **Goods** is rarely used in the singular.

> #### Just-in-time

Of course, it costs money to keep components and goods **in stock** : stocks have to be **financed**(paid for), **stored**(perhaps in special buildings: **warehouse**) and **handled**(move from one to another). So Dryden is asking its suppliers to provide components **just-in-time**, as and when they are needed.

This is part of **lean production** or **lean manufacturing**, making things **efficiently**: doing things as quickly and cheaply as possible, without waste.
