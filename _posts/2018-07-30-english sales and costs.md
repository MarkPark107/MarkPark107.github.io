> ## Sales and costs

> #### Sales 1

Sales describes what a business sells and the money it receives for it. Denis van Beek of Nordsee Marine is having a **sales meeting** with her **sales team** :

'Our **sales figures** and **turnover**(money received from sales) in the last year are good, with **revenue**(money from sales) of 14.5 million euros, on **volume** of 49 boats. This is above our **target** of 13 million euros. We estimate our **sales growth** next year at ten percent, as the world economy looks good and there is demand for our products, so my **sales forecast** is nearly 16 million euros for next year. I'm relying on you!'

Here are some more uses of the word 'sale':

b **be on sale** : be available to buy

c **unit sales** : the number of things sold

d **Sales** : a company department

e **A sale** : a period when a shop is charging less than usual for goods

f **The sales** : a period when a lot of shops are having a sale



> #### Costs

The money that a business spends are its **costs** :

- **direct costs** are directly related to providing the product (e.g. salaries).
- **fixed costs** do not change when production goes up or down (e.g. rent, heating, etc.).
- **variable costs** change when production goes up or down (e.g. materials).
- **cost of goods sold**(= **COGS** or **CGS**) : the variable costs in making particular goods (e.g. materials and salaries).
- **indirect costs**, **overhead costs** or **overheads** are not directly related to production(e.g. administration).

Some costs, especially indirect ones, are also called **expenses**.

**Costing** is the activity of calculating costs. Amount calculated for particular things are **costings**.



> #### Margins and mark-ups

Here are the calculations for one of Nordsee's boats:

- **selling price** = 50,000  euros
- **direct production costs** = 35,000 euros
- selling price minus direct production costs = **gross margin** = 15,000 euros
- **total costs** = 40,000 euros
- **indirect costs** = 5,000 euros
- selling price minus total costs = **net margin**, **profit margin** or **mark-up** = 10,000 euros

The net margin or profit margin is usually given as a percentage of the selling price, in this case 20 percent.

The mark-up is usualy given as a percentage of the total costs, in this case 25 percent.



It is the end of this time : )
