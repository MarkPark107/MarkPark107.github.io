People who buy 'everyday' services such as train travel or telephone services are called **customers**. You can also talk about the **users** or **end-users** of a product or service, who may not be the people who actually buy it. For example, when a company buys computers for its staff to use, the staff are the end-users.

People who buy products or services for their own use are **consumers**, especially when considered as memebers of large groups of people buying things in advanced economies.
