In Britain, a **shopping centre** or **shopping precinct** is a purpose-built area or building in a town centre with a number of shops. Outside towns, there are **shopping malls**, where it is easy to park.

**Franchises** are owned by the people that run them(**franchisees**), but they only sell the goods of one company. That company(the **franchisor**) provides goods, organizes advertising, and offers help and support. In return it takes a percentage of the profits of each franchisee. Many restaurants are also run like this.
