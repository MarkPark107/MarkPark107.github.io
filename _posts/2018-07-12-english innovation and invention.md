> #### Research and technology

Hi, I'm Ray and I'm head of product development at Lightning Technologies. Lightning makes semiconductors, the **components** at the heart of every computer. I'm in charge of research and development(R&D) at our research centre just outside Boston. Our laboratories are some of the most innovative in the computer industry, and we have made many new discoveries and **breakthroughs**.

I love technology, using scientific knowledge for practical purpose. The technology of semiconductors is fascinating. We are at the **cutting edge** or **leading edge** of semiconductor technology: none of our competitors has better products than us. Everything we do is **state-of-the-art**, using the most advanced techniques available.

Of course, the **hi-tech** products of today become the **low-tech** products of tomorrow. Products that are no longer up-to-date because they use old technology are **obsolete** It's my job to make sure that Lightning's products never get into that situation.
