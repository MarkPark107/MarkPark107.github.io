> #### Mass production

I'm Steve and I'm head of car pruduction at a manufacturing plant. 'Plant' sounds more modern than factory or works. On the **assembly** line we **mass-produce** cars. The plant is highly automated: we use a lot of machinery. These robots are part of the CADCAM system of computer-assisted design and manufacturing.

My name's Luke. I have a little workshop where I produce furniture ordered by individual customers. We don't use machnery: the furniture is hand-made. Producing furniture like this is a **craft industry**. It's very **labour-intensive** : it takes a lot of work to produce each piece. Many people dislike the furniture that big companies **churn out** in large numbers on their production lines, so we have a lot of customers.

> #### Capacity and output

Output is the number or type of things that a plant, company, industry or country produces. **Productivity** is a measure of how much is produced in relation to the number of employees.

High output per employee = high productivity.

The maximum amount that a particular plant, company or industry can produce is its **capacity**. If it is producing this amount, it is **working at full capacity**. If it is producing more than what is needed, there is **overproduction** or :

- **excess capacity**
- **spare capacity**
- **overcapacity**
- **surplus capacity**

These expressions can also be used in service industries.

If far too many things are produced, there is a **glut** of these things. If not enough goods are being produced, there is a **shortage**.

Note : overproduction = excess capacity = spare capacity = overcapacity = surplus capacity = glut `OPP` shortage
