> ## The development process

> #### Market research

The **original concept** is the basic idea for something. Indesigning products and services, **market research** - finding out what people want - is of course very important. This may involve **questionnaires** or **surveys**, with questions aoubt what people buy and why, perhaps with interviews in the street or by telephone.

There my be **consumer panels** and **focus groups**, where ordinary people meet to discuss product ideas informally. Perhaps the researchs will make **sales forecasts**, estimates of how many products will be sold.

> #### Development and launch

In software, developers often produce a final test version, the **beta version**, where users are asked to point out **bugs(problems)** before the software is finalized.

Car **designer** use **CADCAM(computer-assisted design/computer-assisted menufacturing)** to help develop and make products and test different **prototypes**.

**Researchers** in **laboratories** may take years to develop new drugs, **testing** or **trialing** them in **trials** to show not only they are **effective**, but aslo they  are **safe**. Drugs need to be made on an **industrial scale** before they can be sold.

**Rollout** is the process of making a product available, perhaps in particular places, to test reaction.

**Product launch** is the moment when the product is officially made available for sale. This is the 'big moment'.

If a **design defect** or **design fault** is found in a product after it has been launched, the company may have to **recall** it, asking those who have bought it to return it, perhaps so that the defect can be corrected.
