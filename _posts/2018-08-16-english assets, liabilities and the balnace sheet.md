> ## Assets, liabliites and balance sheet

> #### Assets

An asset is something that has value, or the power to earn money. These include :

- **current assets** : money in the bank, invenstments that can easily be turned into money, money that customers owe, stocks of goos that are going to be sold.
- **fixed assets** : equipment, machinery, buildings and land.
- **intangible assets** : things which you cannot see. For example, **goodwill** : a company's good reputation with existing customers, adn **brands** : established brands have the power to earn money.

If a company is sold as **a going concern**, it has value as a profit-making operation, or one that could make a profit.

> ## Depreciation

Joanna Cassidy is head of IT(Information Technology) in a publishing company :

'Assets such as machinery and equipment lose value over time because they wear out, or are no longer up-to-date. This is called **depreciation** or **amortization**. For example, when we buy new computers, we **depreciate** them or **amortize** them **over** a very short period, usually three years, adn a **charge** for this is shown in the financial records : the value of the equipment is **written down** each year and **written off** completely at the end.

The value of an asset at any one time is its **book value**. This sin't necessarily the amount that it could be sold for at that time. For example, land or buildings may be worth more than shown in the accounts, because they have increased in value. But computers could only be sold for less than book value.'
