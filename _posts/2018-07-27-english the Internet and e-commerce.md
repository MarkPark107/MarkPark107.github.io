## The Internet and e-commerce

> #### The Internet

When  you look at the web site, you can see :

- web address : an address for websites which pretend a IP address, for example www.naver.com
- banner advertisement : an advertisement in the shape of rectangle on a website
- hyperlinks : a text that re-locates a web page to another
- web page : a page that in a web browser

The **Internet service provider** or **ISP** is the organization that provides you with **Internet access**. You **register** and open an **account**, then they give you an email address so that you can communicate by **email** with othe rusers. Some ISPs have their own **content** - news, information and so on - but man do not. After you **log on** by entering your **user name** and **password**(a secret word that only you know), you can **surf** to any **site** on the **World Wide Web**. If you're looking for a site about a particular subject, you can use a **search engine** like Google or Yahoo. When you've finished, remember to **log off** for **security** reasons.

> #### Clicks-and-mortar

My name's John, and I own a chain of sports shops. Last year, I started an **e-commerce** operation, selling goods over the Internet. We've done well. **Visitors** don't have trouble finding what they want, adding items to their **shopping cart** and paying for then **securely** by credit card.

Last year we had two million **unique users**(different individual visitors) who generated 35 million **hits** or **page views**. That means our web pages were viewed a total of 35 million times!

E-commerce or **e-tailing** has even acted as a form of advertising and increased levles of business in our traditional **bricks-and-mortar** shops! Pure Internet commerce operations are very difficult. To succeed, I think you need a combination of **traditional retailing** and e-commerce: **clicks-and-mortar**. In our case, this has also helped us solve the **last mile problem**j, the **physical delivery** of goods to Internet customers: we just deliver from our local stores!

Selling to the public on the Internet is **business-to-consumer** or **B2C** e-commerce. Some experts think that the real future of e-commerce is going to be **business-to-business** or **B2B**, with firms ordering from suppliers over the Internet. This is **e-procurement**.

Businesses can also use the Internet to communicate with government departments, apply for government contracts and pay taxes: **business-to-government** or **B2G**
