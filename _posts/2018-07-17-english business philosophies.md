Tom Dryden, of Dryden Vaccum Cleaners, believes in quality: 'The **specifications** or **specs** of a product are exact instructions about its design, including its **dimensions**(size), how it is to be made, the materials to be used, etc. The object of **quality control** is **conformity** to specifications, the idea that the product should be made exactly as it was **intended**, with **zero defects** : no faults at all. Things should be done **right first time** so we don't have to correct mistakes later in process of **reworking**. We do **spot checks** every few minutes during production to ensure everything is going well.

We have a system of **total quality management(TQM)**, including **quality circles** : groups of employees who meet regularly to suggest improvements.'
