> ## The bottom line

> #### Accounts

Hi, I'm Fiona and I'm an **accountant.** I work in Edinburgh for one of the big **accountancy firms**. We look at the financial records or **accounts** of a lot of companies. We work with the accountants of those companies, and the people who work under them: the **bookkeepers**. I like my profession: **accountancy**.

Sometimes we act as **auditors**: specialist outside accountants who **audit** a company's accounts, thiat is, we check them at the end of a particular period to see if they give a **true and fair view**(an accurate and complete picture). An **audit** can take several days, even for a fairly small company.

When a company's results are presented in a way that makes them look better than they really are, even if it follows the rules, it may be accused of **creative accounting** or **window dressing**. Of course, I never do this!

> #### Results

'A firm reports its performance in a particular period in its results. Results for a particular year are shown inthe company's **annual report**. This contains, among other things, a **profit and loss account**.

In theory, if a company amkes more money than it spends, it **makes a profit**. If not, it **makes a loss**. But it's possible for a company to show a profit for a particular period because of the way it presents its activities under the **accounting standards** or **accounting rules** of one country, and a loss under the rules of another. My firm operates in many countries and we are very aware of this!

A **pre-tax profit** or a **pre-tax loss** is one before tax is calculated. An **exceptional profit** or **loss** is for something that is not normally repeated, for example the sale of a subsidiary company or the costs of restructuring. A Company's **gross profit** is before charges like these are taken away; its **net profit** is afterwards. The final figure for profit or loss is what people cal informally the **bottom line**. This is what they really worry about!

If a company is making a loss, **commentators** may say that it is **in the red**. They may also use expressions with **red ink**, saying, for example, that a company is **bleeding red ink** or **haemorrhaging red ink**.'
