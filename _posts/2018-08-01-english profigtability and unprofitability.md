> #### Economies of scale and the learning curve

Ford is one of the biggest car companies in the world. It benefits from **economies of scale**. For example, the costs of developing a new car are **enormous**, but the company can spread them over a large number of cars produced and sold. In dealing with suppliers, it can obtain lower prices, because it buys in such large quantities.

The company also benefits from the **experience curve** or **learning curve**: as it produces more, it learns how to do things more and more quickly and efficiently. This brings down the cost of each thing produced, and the more they produce, the cheaper it gets.
