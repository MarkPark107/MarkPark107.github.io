    - a highest level position of a organization or company

- **etc**
  - **line manager**

All the **directors** together are the **board**. They meet in the **boardroom**.

**Non-executive directors** are not managers of the company; they are outsiders, often directors of other companies who have particular knowledge of the industry or of particular areas.

The marketing director is the **head of marketing**, the IT director is the **head of IT**, etc. These people **head** or **head up** their departments. Informally, the head of an activity, a department or an organization is its **boss**.

An **executive** or, informally, an **exec**, is usually a manager at quite a high level (for example, a **senior executive**). But 'executive' can be used in other contexts to suggest luxury, as in 'executive coach' and 'executive home', even for things that are not actually used by executives.
